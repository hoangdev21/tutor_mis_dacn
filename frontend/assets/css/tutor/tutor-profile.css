/* IMPORT MODERN STYLES */
@import url("tutor-profile-modern.css");

/* 
   Legacy styles are below, but should be overridden by the modern styles 
   if the import works correctly. 
   We keep them just in case, but the modern css should take precedence 
   due to specificity or order if we manage it right.
   Actually, to be safe, let's just replace the content or put the import at the top.
